2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/brie2014/cse341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
-Entire app is running with a mongoDB database using mongoose 
-All prior functionality has been updated to use mongoose logic and built in functions
-Actions are user specific (to hardcoded user until we add login functionality)
-You can also submit and view orders

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
It is all working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing I learned was seeing all the included functions in mongoose.
It makes sense to use a library like mongoose to more efficiently and cleanly manage the logic and relationships in the database.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
Please add the link for the txt file template to the assignments in iLearn. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I followed along with all the video tutorials, completed those assignments in full, converted my database to mongoDB and then used the mongoose library to be more efficient. I also made my operations user specific so that a login functionality can be added later on. Additionally, I added subtotals and totals to the cart.

After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
N/A

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
Professional Backend API: https://github.com/brie2014/professional-api
Main: https://github.com/brie2014/cse341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
-REST API created using routes and controllers to allow for more complexity if needed
-REST API returns data
-Data is properly consumed by frontend 

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
It is all working. 

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing I learned with this project was how simple API's really are. I didn't really know how they were made before this lesson, and now I feel comfortable diving in deeper to build a backend. I really enjoyed this assignment and I'm even more excited to work on our final project.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
This assignment was a great way to apply our learnings for the week. My only complaint was I wish the frontend was styled better, but that isn't really relevant to the lesson.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I followed along with all the video tutorials and completed those assignments in full. My API is fully functioning and returns a response with data that matches what the frontend is trying to consume.
